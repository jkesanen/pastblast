Pastblast - A command line Last.fm track submitter

Scans track information from single media files and directories (of media 
files) to submit (scrobble) them into user's Last.fm account. 

I like to follow what I listen to and how often. It guides my album purchases 
and reminds me of what I haven't been listening for a long time. Currently I 
have almost six years worth of my listening habbits on Last.fm. At some point 
I needed an application that could submit the tracks I have listened in car, 
on living room's CD player, using my SanDisk Sansa Clip ogg/flac/wma/mp3 
player. Thus Pastblast.

  - Uses Mutagen library to access metadata from tracks
